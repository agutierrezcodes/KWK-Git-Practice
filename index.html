        <h2>KWK and coding journey</h2>
            <p>My first introduction to coding was through Codecademy in 2017. There, I learned HTML and CSS and decided to major in Computer Science. I later attended KWK's 2020 web development camp that took place just before my senior year of high school. I initially heard about it from Tik Tok lol and actually applied on the last day that applications were open. 
            I also attended KWK's 2021 Data Science camp. I learned Python, C++, Java, C, SQL, and JavaScript (and some JS frameworks) from several courses I took during high school and college. </p>
